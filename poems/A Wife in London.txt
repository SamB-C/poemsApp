A Wife in London

I - The Tradegy

She sits in the tawny vapour
    That the City lanes have uprolled,
    Behind whose webby fold on fold
Like a waning taper
    The street-lamp glimmers cold.


A messenger's knock cracks smartly,
    Flashed news in her hand
    Of meaning it dazes to understand
Though shaped so shortly:
    He - has fallen - in the far south land ...

II - The Irony

'Tis the morrow; the fog hangs thicker,
    The postman nears and goes:
    A letter is brought whose lines disclose
By the firelight flicker
    His hand, whom the worm now knows:


Fresh - firm - penned in highest feather -
    Page-full of his hoped return,
    And of home-planned jaunts by brake and burn
In the summer weather,
    And of new love that they would learn.

Thomas Hardy
