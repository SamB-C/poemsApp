Here, every spring\nI would fill jampotfuls of the jellied\nSpecks to range on window-sills at home,\nOn shelves at school, and wait and watch until\nThe fattening dots burst into nimble-\nSwimming tadpoles. Miss Walls would tell us how\nThe daddy frog was called a bullfrog\nAnd how he croaked and how the mammy frog\nLaid hundreds of little eggs and this was\nFrogspawn. You could tell the weather by frogs too\nFor they were yellow in the sun and brown\nIn rain.\n\n    Then one hot day when fields were rank\nWith cowdung in the grass and angry frogs\nInvaded the flax-dam; I ducked through hedges\nTo a coarse croaking that I had not heard\nBefore. The air was thick with a bass chorus.\nRight down the dam gross-bellied frogs were cocked\nOn sods; their loose necks pulsed like sails. Some hopped:\nThe slap and plop were obscene threats. Some sat\nPoised like mud grenades, their blunt heads farting.\nI sickened, turned and ran. The great slime kings\nWere gathered there for vengance and I knew\nThat if I dipped my hand the spawn would clutch it.\n\nSeamus Heaney","Hawk Roosting":"Hawk Roosting\n\nI sit in the top of the wood, my eyes closed.\nInaction, no falsifying dream\nBetween my hooked head and hooked feet:\nOr in sleep rehearse perfect kills and eat.\n\nThe convenience of the high trees!\nThe air's buoyancy and the sun's ray\nAre of advantage to me;\nAnd the earth's face upward for my inspection.\n\nMy feet are locked upon the rough bark.\nIt took the whole of Creation\nTo produce my foot, my each feather:\nNow I hold Creation in my foot\n\nOr fly up, and revolve it all slowly -\nI kill where I please because it is all mine.\nThere is no sophistry in my body:\nMy manners are tearing off heads -\n\nThe allotment of death.\nFor the one path of my flight is direct\nThrough the bones of the living.\nNo arguments assert my right:\n\nThe sun is behind me.\nNothing has changed since I began.\nMy eye has permitted no change.\nI am going to keep things like this.\n\nTed Hughes","To Autumn":"To Autumn\n\nSeasons of mist and mellow fruitfulness!\n  Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;\nConspiring with him how to load and bless\n  With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;\nTo bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,\n  And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;\n    To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells\n  With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,\nAnd still more, later flowers for the bees,\nUntil they think warm days will never cease,\n    For Summer has o'erbrimmed their clammy cells.\n\nWho hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?\n  Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find\nThee sitting careless on a granary floor,\n  Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;\nOr on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,\n  Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook\n    Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers;\nAnd sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep\n  Steady thy laden head across a brook;\n  Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,\n    Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.\n\nWhere are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?\n  Think not of them, thou hast thy music too, -\nWhile barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,\n  And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;\nThen in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn\n  Among the river sallows, borne aloft\n    Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;\nAnd full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;\n  Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft\n  The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;\n    And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.\n\nJohn Keats","Afternoons":"Afternoons\n\nSummer is fading:\nThe leaves fall in ones and twos\nFrom trees bordering\nThe new recreation ground.\nIn the hollows of afternoons\nYoung mothers assemble\nAt swing and sandpit\nSetting free their children.\n\nBehind them, at intervals,\nStand husbands in skilled trades,\nAn estateful of washing,\nAnd the albums, lettered\nOur Wedding, lying\nNear the television:\nBefore them, the wind\nIs ruining their courting-places\n\nThat are still courting-places\n(But the lovers are all in school),\nAnd their children, so intent on\nFinding more unripe acorns,\nExpect to be taken home.\nTheir beauty has thickened.\nSomething is pushing them\nTo the side of their own lives.\n\nPhilip Larkin","Dulce et Decorum Est":"Dulce et Decorum Est\n\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks,\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge.\nMen marched asleep. Many had lost their boots\nBut limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots\nOf gas shells dropping softly behind.\n\nGas! Gas! Quick, boys! - An ecstasy of fumbling,\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time;\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling,\nAnd flound'ring like a man in fire or lime ...\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light,\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\n\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight,\nHe plunges at me, guttering, chocking, drowning.\n\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in,\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face,\nHis hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood \nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, -\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory,\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est\nPro patria mori\n\nWilfred Owen","Ozymandias":"Ozymandias\n\nI met a traveller from an antique land\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\nStand in the desert. . .
